                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>As a long time fan of garfield It was by no means easy to rank my favorite comic strips; 
                        But I managed to do it. 
                        Listed below are my top three favorite comics of all time.</p>

                    <h3>Comic #3</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="orange/comic-3.png" alt="Garfield Comic #3" class="comic">

                    <br>
                    <p>In this comic Garfield Garfield stuffs Nermal into a sugar bowl, 
                        teaching him a lesson in humility. 
                        I find the idea of a “humalty lesson” amusing and the tail sticking out of the bowl makes the comic even funnier. 
                        I would say that this comic is my third favorite Garfield comic of all.</p>

                    <h3>Comic #2</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="orange/comic-2.png" alt="Garfield Comic #2" class="comic">
                        <figcaption><cite>Davis</cite></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I think that the simpiclty of this comic is part of what makes it so great. 
                        Jon is seen jinxing his luck by celebrating a day without anything bad happening. 
                        Knowing the shenanigans Garfield gets up to we can infer that Jons victory will be short lived. 
                        This comic solidify lands in as my second favorite Garfield comic</p>

                    <h3>Comic #1</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="orange/comic-1.png" alt="Garfield Comic #1" class="comic">
                        <figcaption><cite>Davis</cite></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In this comic Garfield is seen wanting to be fed while Jon is busy trying to entertain us, 
                        I feel like this does a great job summarizing Jon and Garfield as characters; 
                        showing Jon as as down to earth everyman and Garfield as a hedonistic force of comedy. 
                        Over all, I  find this extremely funny, funny enough to make it my favorite Gargfield Comic of all time.</p>
