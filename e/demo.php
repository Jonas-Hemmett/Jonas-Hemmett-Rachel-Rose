<h1>Spaghetti Facts!</h1>
<img alt="Pasta" src="images/pasta.png">
<p>Spaghetti is the plural form of the Italian word spaghetto, which is a diminutive of spago, meaning “thin string” or “twine.”</p>
<p>The world record for largest bowl of spaghetti was set in March 2009 and reset in March 2010 when a restaurant in Garden Grove, Buca di Beppo, outside of Los Angeles successfully filled a swimming pool with more than 13,780 pounds of pasta.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, over 1.3 million pounds of spaghetti were sold in American grocery stores.</p>
